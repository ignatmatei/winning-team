Internships  June 2015 ‚Äì September 2015  
 Company:  Bloomberg LP, New York  
Role: Software Developer Engineering Intern  
Period:  16 June 2015 ‚Äì 4 September  2015 
In Bloomberg Vault team , my project consist ed in developing (POC) a highly scalable 
NLP model for understanding people contextual interaction (via email and instant 
messaging) within  Bloomberg Professional Service  and detect compliance policy 
violations. First, the project propose d a new way of repre senting text: corpuses as a 
collection of t opics  and each document as a mixture of topics using LDA  modeling. On 
top of this, we use d Logistic Regression (a supervised learning, classification model) 
for detecting policy violations.  
  
 November 2014 ‚ÄìMay 2015 
 Company:  Bitdefender Bucharest, RO  
Role:  Machine learning researcher  
Period:  17 November  2014 ‚Äì15 May 2015 
As part of my current master degree, I do my research project with Bitdefender. The 
research is about "User Profiling": cr eate a user profile  based on it s online activity. This 
includes 2 cases: static in time (based only on previous activity) and behavioral 
(dynamic over time) by combining memory -based and collaborative based models. The 
scope of the research topic was to obtain the POC  for cl ustering users based on their 
preferences and correlate results with the proneness (exposure) to different types of 
security risk s in order to offer a custom, user -oriented security solution.  
  
 July 2014 ‚Äì October 2014  
 Company:  Microsoft Redmond, WA  
Role:  Software Developer Engineering Intern  
Period:  11 July 2014 ‚Äì 05 October 2014  
I was part of the Media Team, which was mainly focused on Multimedia Casting. My 
intern project was implementing a XAML Common Media Element Control (internally 
linked to Windows Media Casting Technologies and Device Picker) in order to remove 
the burden f or App Developers to implement Media Casting. During my project I got 
familiar with COM concepts, implemented a new XAML Control and a back -end 
wrapper over the Windows Device Picker as a WinRT object for deduping devices 
supporting multiple casting techno logies.  
  
 July 2013 ‚Äì October 2013  
 Company:  Bloomberg LP, London  
Role: Software Developer Engineering Intern  
Period:  1 July 2013 ‚Äì 18 October 2013  
I was part of the R&D Feeds team, which was mainly focused on gathering and parsing 
incoming financial data. My intern project was implementing a new tool to compare the 
‚Äúhealth‚Äù of a particular feed by comparing the time evolution of a feature vector set 
against a reference feature vector set and trigger alarms whenever current vector 
deviates ‚Äútoo much‚Äù f rom the reference vector. The ability to learn a parser behavior 
and adapt to changes in time would reflect on the tool ability to adjust the alarm trigger 
mechanism. The tool acted as a platform which could use independent learning algorithms in order to build (and compare to) the reference vector. During the project I 
also implemented a first algorithm to be used with the tool, based on Standard 
Deviation and Variance.

extraction, filtering and testing).¬†
‚óè The project was primarily implemented in ‚ÄãC++11‚Äã, while ‚ÄãTensorFlow‚Äã code was¬†
written in ‚ÄãPython‚Äã. I also had to write and ‚Äãdynamically generate SQL¬†
statements to prepare the data and feed it into the pipeline.¬†
‚óè The tool I wrote enables anyone at Google to test their ML ideas ‚Äãquickly and¬†
safely‚Äã, essentially allowing for ‚Äãfaster innovation‚Äã.¬†

WORK EXPERIENCE ¬†
Google, ‚ÄãZurich ‚Äî ‚ÄãSoftware Engineering Intern (SWE)¬†
Local Shopping¬†
JULY 2019 - OCTOBER 2019¬†
Worked on a project that helps the Local Shopping team ‚Äãsuggest better results‚Äã to users¬†
looking to ‚Äãbuy products‚Äã (from stores) in their proximity.¬†
‚óè The first part of the internship was focused on building a baseline mechanism¬†
based on an heuristic. It enabled me to ‚Äãunderstand the code base‚Äã, the¬†
limitations of the system and use it as a guideline for ‚Äãfurther experimentation‚Äã.¬†
‚óè In the second part of the internship I produced multiple complete ‚ÄãMachine¬†
Learning‚Äã pipelines (containing data importing, data transformation, data¬†
analysis, training, evaluating, fine-tuning, pushing, continuous end-to-end¬†
processing etc.) which proved better than the initial heuristic.¬†¬†
‚óè I iterated over several models, starting from simple ‚ÄãLinear Regression‚Äã models¬†
to more complicated ones, such as ‚ÄãWide and Deep‚Äã. I particularly enjoyed¬†
experimenting with the feature transformation step trying several ‚Äãembeddings¬†
and ‚Äãfeature crosses‚Äã based on the ‚Äãmutual information‚Äã observed in the data¬†
analysis phase.¬†¬†
‚óè The project was primarily implemented using ‚ÄãPython‚Äã, ‚ÄãTensorflow‚Äã, ‚ÄãTFX‚Äã, ‚ÄãSQL‚Äã,¬†
C++11‚Äã and configuration languages.¬†
‚óè My work enables the Local Shopping team to better understand the¬†
implications between lots of factors among which it's important to mention¬†
the users, the things they want to buy and the available places to buy from.¬†

JUNE 2018 - SEPTEMBER 2018¬†
Worked on a project that allows Google engineers to easily experiment with ‚ÄãMachine¬†

‚óè The first part of the internship was ‚Äãdesign oriented‚Äã and had a strong ‚Äãresearch¬†
component, resulting in a proof of concept pipeline for training and testing¬†
TensorFlow models at scale.¬†
‚óè In the second part of the internship I implemented a tool that produced a full¬†
ML pipeline (including code and configuration for data access, feature¬†
extraction, filtering and testing).¬†
‚óè The project was primarily implemented in ‚ÄãC++11‚Äã, while ‚ÄãTensorFlow‚Äã code was¬†

resolutions images of multiple formats by exploiting efficient memory usage .
‚Ä¢Has a Command Line Interface that supports several parameters and can read and write image files.
Load Balancer |C
‚Ä¢The program uses Consistent Hashing on ahash-ring structure which can contain up to 100.000 linked
servers where the client can store and retrieve any product associated with an ID. The servers‚Äô memory is designed
by using hash tables and maintained zero memory leaks on usage.
‚Ä¢If one server is shutting down, all the products stored on it are rebalanced without any loss on the closest
server available.
Rope Data Structure |C
‚Ä¢Implemented a data structure which is used to store very long strings and manipulate them efficiently .
Ropes drastically cut down the cost of appending two strings.
‚Ä¢ARope is aweight balanced Binary Tree where each leaf node holds a string or a sub-string. Unlike arrays,
ropes do not require large contiguous memory allocations .

 HOW TO REACH ME
First year Bachelor in Computer Science and
Engineering at Politehnica University of Bucharest.
Cumulative grades for the 1st year : 9.47/10.EDUCATION

EXTRACURRICULAR
Romanian National Programming Olympiad -
County Stage (2018)
Former GROW volunteer: international association
that helps you structure coaching and mentoring
skills. At the end of this program I organized a
basketball championship for which I managed to
attract sponsorship from local sport shops.
Erasmus+ participant: international project that
promotes the qualities and the importance of a
durable and united future between different
countries.Basic Good
Linux
Bash/Shell Scripting
OctaveC
C++
Data StructuresImplemented voice controlled commands using
Arduino parts (Uno, Mega) on a 1975 Dacia 1300
such as: locking/unlocking the doors and trunk,
turning on the lights independently
Every action is shown on a screen inside the car
and can be triggered from a phone using a
Bluetooth app I also designed myself
A thermometer that warns you when there is
danger of ice on the road was also implemented
The car's electrics were modified completely: start-
stop button, 4 power windows, central locking,
navigation system, self-rising electric trunkVoice controlled commands on a car (2020)
C written application (CLI interface) that is able to
select a certain area from a picture (PGM or PPM)
and apply different modifications to it: crop,
rotate, grayscale, sepia
This project improved my working with both text
and binary files and string parsing skills
D eveloping formulas that transformed the matrices
in particular forms resulted into a time efficiency
30% better than re-applying the same algorithm for
every picture Image editor (2021)
C based code that stores items efficiently in a
"key-value" pair on certain servers
A hash-ring structure where each server had 3
copies on different positions on the ring was
implemented in order to evenly distribute these
items on the available servers;  this improved the
overall performance by 40%, greatly reducing the
chance to overfill one of the servers
It allows the user to add and remove servers or
items and retrieve the information of a certain item
previously stored in the system; every change made
to the servers list implies a redistribution of all the
items in the system, so that storing efficiency is
maintainedLoad Balancer (2021)
A bash script that receives information about the
weather in different cities and assure CRUD
(CReate Update Delete) control over a given
database, reducing the use of memory from 24
different entries a day to only oneWeather system automatization (2020)

communication  by implementing a shared public problems record system that allows votes and comments 
from users . 
‚Ä¢ Potential to reduce interaction times  between in stitutions and citizens from days to hours . 
‚Ä¢ Implemented location services using the Google Maps API  to display the issues on an interactive map.  
‚Ä¢ Learned DDD (Domain Driven De velopment ) and TDD (Test Driven De velopment ) by researching and 
implementing  these methodologies at the API level.   
Java Programmer @ First Tech Challenge ‚Äì Team Tea -Borgs                                                           Nov 2019 ‚Äì Jun 2020

‚Ä¢ Placed 1st out of 40 teams  at the 2020 Timisoara Regional Championship and qualified for the National 
Championship  of FTC , an international competition  where teams design, build , and code robots.  
‚Ä¢ Implemented algorithms using gyros copes  and wheel odometry that increased the  AI accuracy to 90%.  
‚Ä¢ Used computer vision  with Tensorflow and Vuforia to determine  the initial position of the robot on the 
playing field  in order to use the right algorithm.  
Arduino Programmer @ High School Researchers Night                                                                                          Oct 2019  
‚Ä¢ Raised the interest of  ~50  high school student s regarding  physics by volunteering  and creating an 
interactive  Arduino project that aims to showcas e the propagation of sound waves.  
‚Ä¢ With the press of a button , a speaker  placed in a jar  produced sound for a few seconds and the volume was 
measure d. A vacuum pump started afterwards, removing the air from the jar. When  this was done, the 
speaker started again, but the measured volume was much lower.  This demonstrated that the sound waves 
need a medium  to vibrate through  and can‚Äôt travel in a perfect vacuum.
